# Bonsai.ML - Examples

The Bonsai.ML project is a collection of packages built to target the Bonsai-Rx ecosystem, providing reactive infrastructure for machine learning operations.

We provide examples/demos for how to get started using the suite of Bonsai.ML packages that are currently available. We provide documentation for each example to illustrute how Bonsai.ML modules/workflows can be incorporated into Bonsai-Rx workflows.
